                    <p class="text-pads" class="education">When I discovered that myo-electric prosthetic hands cost between 20,000 and 200,000 USD and are not covered by health care in Canada, I decided to take action. I learned 3D design and coding, and subsequently founded NeurobioNX, a startup focused on creating affordable myo-electric prosthetics. Our goal was to develop a high-accuracy, functional prosthetic hand for under 5,000 CAD.

                        Unfortunately, the startup had to be paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in my free time, I continue to work on the project, striving to develop free, open-source myo-electric hands that can be 3D-printed and assembled anywhere in the world.

                        NeurobioNX was created. A startup that aim at building a myo-electric prosthetic with accuracy and functionality in mind while keeping the cost to below 5,000 CAD.
                        Unfortunately, the startup had to be stopped during COVID times. However, the efforts are still being pushed forward to create free, open-source myoelectric hands that can be 3D-printed and built anywhere in the world.
