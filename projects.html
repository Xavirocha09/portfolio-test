                    <p class="text-pads" class="education">When I discovered that myo-electric prosthetic hands cost between 20,000 and 200,000 USD and are not covered by health care in Canada, I decided to take action. I learned 3D design and coding, and subsequently founded NeurobioNX, a startup focused on creating affordable myo-electric prosthetics. Our goal was to develop a high-accuracy, functional prosthetic hand for under 5,000 CAD.

                        Unfortunately, the startup had to be paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in my free time, I continue to work on the project, striving to develop free, open-source myo-electric hands that can be 3D-printed and assembled anywhere in the world.

                        I self-taught myself how to code using HTML, CSS and PHP. After my found love for code I desided to take courses to cement my knowledge and grow it. Now I have finished learning and mastering JavaScript as well.
