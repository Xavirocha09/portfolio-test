                    <p class="text-pads" class="education">When I discovered that myo-electric prosthetic hands cost between 20,000 and 200,000 USD and are not covered by health care in Canada, I decided to take action. I learned 3D design and coding, and subsequently founded NeurobioNX, a startup focused on creating affordable myo-electric prosthetics. Our goal was to develop a high-accuracy, functional prosthetic hand for under 5,000 CAD.

                        Unfortunately, the startup had to be paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in my free time, I continue to work on the project, striving to develop free, open-source myo-electric hands that can be 3D-printed and assembled anywhere in the world.

                        I self-taught myself how to code using HTML, CSS and PHP. After my found love for code I desided to take courses to cement my knowledge and grow it. Now I have finished learning and mastering JavaScript as well.
                        This entire website was made from scratch. It has been my longest project in this area. From the design of the pictures shapes, to the different fonts, sizes and weights to the spaces in between each element, each division and each section, between sentences and words. 
                        All to ensure the perfect melange between professionalism and self-expression.
